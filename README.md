# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends in a wide variety of campaigns. The process of using data from past projects to identify succes and failure rates based on launch date and outcomes .
## Analysis and Challenge
- For outcomes based on launch date I created a pivot table that allowed me to narrow down to specific catergories to see the outcomes by month. I was able to use a chart to show the difference in successful vs failed and canceled campaigns. I applied statistical formulas to find outliers or determine deviations.

- For outcomes based on goals I was able to look at the percentages of the ammount successful, canceled, and failed. Showing the percentages of the goals met in a line graph made it much easier to see the range and understand the success rate.

- I found using the COUNTIFS function very challenging. Once I was able to understand the format I was able to plug in the information properly. When I understood the order I was able to adjust minor variables to complete gathering information. 
## Results
- Based on the date from Outcomes Based on Launch Date I was able to see that the theater campaigns in the summer months seemed to be more successful, where as the winter months seemed to be less successful. So the best time to launch a campaing would be in May or June. 
- Outcomes Based on Goals seemed to be more successful when the goal was a lower ammount. Setting a more reasonable goal will result in a more successful campaign rate. 
-  Some of the limitiations of the data set are not having a reference to why the campaign failed. Identifying backers by gender may help in finding target audiences as well.
